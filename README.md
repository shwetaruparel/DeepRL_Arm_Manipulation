# Deep RL Arm Manipulation

This project is based on the Nvidia open source project "jetson-reinforcement" developed by [Dustin Franklin](https://github.com/dusty-nv). The goal of the project is to create a DQN agent and define reward functions to teach a robotic arm to carry out two primary objectives:

1. Have any part of the robot arm touch the object of interest, with at least a 90% accuracy.
2. Have only the gripper base of the robot arm touch the object, with at least a 80% accuracy.

## Building from Source (Nvidia Jetson TX2)

Run the following commands from terminal to build the project from source:


During the `cmake` step, Torch will be installed so it can take awhile. It will download packages and ask you for your `sudo` password during the install.

## Testing the API

The plugins which hook the learning into the simulation are located in the `gazebo/` directory of the repo. The RL agent and the reward functions are to be defined in [`ArmPlugin.cpp`](gazebo/ArmPlugin.cpp).
